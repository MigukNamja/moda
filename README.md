Introduction
Pollution is caused by burning fossil fuels and works a lot like Thaumcraft Flux. Pollution in this mod is kept in each chunk. When there is no pollution, there are no ill effects. As pollution increases, players take damage, experience nausea, blurred vision, etc. Oxygen levels decrease with increased pollution, which results in lower power output from fossil fuel energy sources. Crops stop growing and may even die off at the highest pollution levels.
 
Why Pollution ?
The idea is to encourage the player to move beyond early-game fuels like charcoal, coal, and oil and progress into wind, water, solar, and nuclear. Tree farms that produce wood that is either burned directly, as planks, or as charcoal will be hit especially hard. This mod is certainly not for every pack.
 
Spread
Pollution spreads to surrounding chunks, which lowers pollution in the course chunk where pollution is being generated, but increases pollution in the surrounding chunks.
 
Avoidance and Mitigation
Pollution can be avoided entirely by not burning fossil fuels. In most packs' early game, it is almost impossible to avoid pollution entirely. It is  advised to limit furnace activity to a minimum and use mods which draw power from wind, water, solar, nuclear, etc..
 
In future versions of the mod, trees, crops, and other fauna will decrease pollution. There will also be pollution scrubbers and other mechanisms that either filter pollution at the source or clean it up in the general environment.
